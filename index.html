            <p><strong>From the desk of David Russell,<br>Date: <span id="spanDate"></span></strong></p>
            <p>Dear Friend,</p>
            <p>It's time of the year when you need to submit your performance review report and get ready for the interview with your boss.</p>
            <p>You've worked hard through the year and you would like to capture as much of your achievements in the report as possible. While highlighting your strengths, you're also trying to downplay some of the areas where you have not been too successful in meeting expectations.</p> 
            <p>I can imagine how you're feeling now. You've been writing for awhile and is at the point where you are now struggling with the right words to describe your successes.</p>
            <p>You're concern with your boss not getting full visibility over your great work during the review period. You're worried about your boss' bosses reading your performance appraisal report and not getting a good impression of you.</p>
            <p>The good news is you're not the only one facing these worries at appraisal time. Even your bosses have the same challenges. They too struggle with their performance appraisals.</p>
            <p>But, you know what, they are not better than you in writing good comments in appraisals. Like most other people, they probably get help from appraisal comments or phrases guide books.</p>
            <p class="subT">Why Are Performance Appraisal Comments Or Phrases Guides So Useful &amp; Popular?</p>
            <p>I'll tell you why so many people are using them and why you should do the same...</p>
            <p>First of all, you do not have to think so hard for the right words to describe your achievements or camouflage your weaknesses. There are hundreds of ready-to-use phrases which many people have use effectively in their appraisals. These comments have been crafted and refined over the years, and you do not have to reinvent the wheel! Use and adapt them to your situations and you will make your appraisals look very impressive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the choices of words and phrases are very concise and impactful! Such phrases will help you to clearly and succinctly articulate your achievements and impress your boss with your writing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you do not have to spend much time writing the appraisal. You will have more time to prepare for your interview. While your appraisal form captures in writing your achievements, it cannot replace the verbal communications during the interview with your boss. You must dedicate time to review your key achievements mentally and be able to articulate them well during the discussion.</p>
            <p><strong>You do not have to struggle anymore! Just do what others are doing to get the better appraisal results!</strong></p>
